<h1>Big Brain Quiz</h1>

<p> Many people already know about educational quizzes, but few know their true potential.</p>
<p>An educational quiz is a tool that can be used in a classroom, course, or for reviewing content in a teaching process.</p>
<p>This game also has an evaluation method.</p>
<p>We can say that quizzes are a practical way of learning, because this method assesses the degree of prior knowledge of a student on a given topic, as well as evaluating what is retained after entering the classroom in an interesting and innovative way.</p>

<h3>Improvements to be Implemented</h3>
<ul>
<li>Insert Intermediate and Advanced Levels Sections</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known Bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>When the login screen was started an internal error and when the start game button was clicked this error disappeared and entered another in its place for the same reason.</li>
<ul>
<li>With the help of the tutors I could realize that the error was generated because there were two HTML pages, the error was solved compatctando all the content of two HTML pages in one and making the necessary adaptations in the code.</li>
