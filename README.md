<h1>Big Brain Quiz</h1>

<p> Many people already know about educational quizzes, but few know their true potential.</p>
<p>An educational quiz is a tool that can be used in a classroom, course, or for reviewing content in a teaching process.</p>
<p>This game also has an evaluation method.</p>
<p>We can say that quizzes are a practical way of learning, because this method assesses the degree of prior knowledge of a student on a given topic, as well as evaluating what is retained after entering the classroom in an interesting and innovative way.</p>

Codi Academy TV</a> project for learning purposes and due to time constraints. Improvements such as question counter, user greeting have been implemented and congratulations message at the end with percentage of hits.

<li>Youtube channel in which I used the video / code as reference for this project, I found it interesting to use it because it explains in a clear way how to transform functions into methods and objects, for better code refactoring. A different strategy of the proposed but I found it of great value and that added much knowledge.</li>

<h2>Clarifications</h2>
<p>Whenever I write code, I simultaneously work on other repositories to run different tests, but out of distraction I left files open while deleting old repositories, and ended up mistakenly deleting my almost finished project.</p>
<p>Nothing justifies it, I learned from my mistake.</p>
